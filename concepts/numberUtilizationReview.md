# Number Utilization Review (Limited Availability)

Due to telecom regulations, Bandwidth is required to report on what phone numbers owned by Bandwidth are in use by our customers. Bandwidth is able to track the usage on some of these phone numbers and determine if these phone numbers are in use or not in use, but the non-trackable phone numbers require our customers to assign each number as in use or not in use. Our newly released Number Utilization Review feature allows you to do this with ease.

The API endpoint for using the Number Utilization Review can be found [here](../apiReference.md) under /accounts /{accountId} /numbersAssignment.

A detailed step by step guide to using the Number Utilization Review in the dashboard can be found [here](numberUtilizationReviewDashboard.md).
