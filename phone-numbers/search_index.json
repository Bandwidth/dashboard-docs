Typically the UI (or Dashboard) refers to the resource as a sub-account while the API refers to the resource as a site.  These are 100% interchangable.\n\nNavigate to the Sub-account page\nAccount > Configuration > Sub-accounts\n\n\nTo add a sub account, click the 'Add a sub-account' Button\nOnce you have at least one sub-account, click the manage button to get the Id.\n\n\nBasic Auth \nThe Bandwidth API methods are accessed through HTTPS to protect sensitive customer data against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Basic HTTP authentication is used with encryption via TLS. Basic HTTP authentication is supported by all browsers commonly in use, and the HTTP clients of most programming languages, and is straightforward to implement.\nFor examples on client authentication, please review information at: http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/examples.html\nContact the Bandwidth Customer Experience Team for new credentials, password resets or access to additional purchased features.\nThe bandwidth dashboard requires the use of one of the versions of TLS: as of the appearance of the POODLE SSL vulnerability the support for SSL has been discontinued.\n"},"concepts/restAPI.html":{"url":"concepts/restAPI.html","title":"RESTful API and Environments","keywords":"","body":"RESTful API and Environments \nOverview\n\nAPI Methods - REST\nUsage of REST with the Bandwidth Phone Number API\nBase URLs and Environments\nREST URLs and Parameters\n\nAPI Methods - REST \nBandwidth API’s support REST web service technologies.\nThe Bandwidth API’s are designed to provide customers with a simple way of interfacing with the number intelligence platform following standard industry practices.  Wikipedia (reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) defines REST as:\n\nA RESTful web service (also called a RESTful web API) is a simple web service implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST. It is a collection of resources, with four defined aspects:\n\nA base URI for the web service, such as http://example.com/resources/\nAn Internet media type of the data supported by the web service. This is often JSON, XML or YAML but can be any other valid Internet media type.\nA set of operations supported by the web service using HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).\nThe API must be hypertext driven.\n\n\nUsage of REST with the Bandwidth Phone Number API \nUsage of the REST model for APIs involves using the tools provided by the REST model to create a consistent API experience.  Bandwidth’s Phone Number APIs use:\nGET\nGET  for querying static resources, often paginating the results to manage large result sets that arise from dealing with large data sets such as Telephone Numbers\n\nSearch available number inventory\nREST HTTP GET\n\n\nReporting\nREST HTTP GET\n\n\n\nPOST and PUT\nPOST for creating resources, and PUT for updating resources.  In many cases POST results in the return of an identifier that is used in the subsequent management of that resource.\n\nOrdering numbers\nREST HTTP POST\n\n\nSIP Peer Management\nREST HTTP POST and PUT\n\n\n\nDELETE\nDEL  is seldom used.  In most cases, resources are persisted as history records and cannot be deleted.\nBase URLs and Environments \nAll resources are located at:\n\nBase URL for Interop – https://test.dashboard.bandwidth.com/api\nBase URL for Production – https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api\n\nThe payload/content of the REST messages is encoded in XML.  To provide information to the endpoints on how to interpret the content, a HTTP Header value is used to identify the content as XML content.  To achieve this the header “Content-Type” must be set as “application/xml” for all messages.  The “Authorization” header is used to include the Basic-encoded credentials\nAPI Calls to the Base URL will return an empty document (no content), and not perform any authentication or other processing.  A REST resource is required for any action on the part of the server.\nREST URLs and Parameters \nBandwidth attempts to maintain syntactic consistency in the specification and execution of the Bandwidth Dashboard API.  Some of the guidelines that serve as goals are:\n\nBackwards compatibility – Bandwidth remains committed to backwards compatibility in its API implementation, occasionally at the expense of API complexity or additional query parameters.\nDate flexibility – for most API calls that have dates as query parameters, the format yyyy-mm-dd or yy-mm-dd will be supported\nCase insensitivity – in many but not all cases elements of the REST URI are case insensitive.  Some resource names and identifiers are case sensitive by their nature, and some have not yet been converted to case insensitive parsing.\nProviding generic, robust resource descriptors for URIs remains a focus of the ongoing development, and will be attempted wherever changes can be made that do not violate our commitment to backwards compatibility.\n\n"},"concepts/asyncOrder.html":{"url":"concepts/asyncOrder.html","title":"Asynchronous Order Model","keywords":"","body":"Asynchronous Order Model\nMany system requests require the interaction of multiple “back-end” systems, and cannot be guaranteed to complete within a short time interval.  Additionally, for many of these requests it is valuable to retain a persistent record of the transaction or series of transactions.  Ordering Features and Services, and requesting number Porting, both fit into this class of activity.\nIn these cases, the Bandwidth Phone Number APIs use an Asynchronous model, where the initial request results in the creation of a unique “order”, which is identified by an order-id which is typically returned in the Location header of a POST request.  This order-id is then subsequently used to monitor and update the initial request.  In general, these order-ids are represented by a UUID, and will be preserved at least for the length of time required to fully complete the request.  Their status can be requested at any time, and in cases the request can be modified\n"},"concepts/accountConfig.html":{"url":"concepts/accountConfig.html","title":"Account Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Account Configuration Model\nThe basic work-flow for configuring an account, and subsequently managing numbers on that account is diagrammed below.

They are useful but they cannot be completely trusted for three reasons...\n\nWe use URL redirects that confuse things.\nWe use programmatic control over payload elements that are not visible in the WADL schema\nThe annotation of the payloads is incomplete and not completely wired in.\n\nTherefore, they are largely correct when available, but not perfect.  They can provide a shortcut to code generation, but you may see differences between the WADL schema and the formal spec.\nPlease feel free to use these to speed your development, but please also be aware that there are permissions-based programmatic alterations that are made to the XML payloads for certain API calls that will not show up in the WADL schema for those resources.   Use carefully.\nAny primary resource will expose its WADL schema if you use the queryparameter ?_wadl as in https://test.dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts?_wadl\nIn cases where we have employed

of the options available for authentication of the callback API calls is to use a Mutual Authentication mechanism, where both parties validate the identity of the other party using the SSL certificate exchange mechanism.\nThe general mechanism for supporting this authentication mechanism is as follows, courtesy of the Oracle Java EE 6 tutorial on security\n\nA client requests access to a protected resource.\nThe web server presents its certificate to the client.\nThe client verifies the server’s certificate.\nIf successful, the client sends its certificate to the server.\nThe server verifies the client’s credentials.\nIf successful, the server grants access to the protected resource requested by the client.\n\nThis is captured in the image below\n\nThis model will ensure that the communication is private, the parties are valid certificate holders, and that the parties are who they said they are, because their valid certificates match a previously declared public key.\nFrom an implementation perspective the public key that you want us to verify against is passed in the  element of the /subscription. We will securely retain that public key, and validate that the public key matches the certificate presented in the initial response (2 above) from the server. This indicates that we have connected to the correct server. The next step in completing the bi-directional identity confirmation is for the Server to check the certificate presented in step 4, to ensure that the request is coming from Bandwidth. We can provide you with the public key that you should be checking, or you can retrieve it from the certificate presented as part of a standard exchange with our network edge (see below).\nThe  value presented in a POST request new subscription should be a Base 64 encoding of the public key that is presented on requests to the Server that implements the callback handler. It can be saved as a Base 64 encoding of the certificate. To ensure compatibility we require that the file be Base 64 encoded again to ensure that the start and end characters, as well as any others which are not Base 64 encoded are included in the Base 64 blob that we store.\nBy way of example, if I wanted to set up a blob to store in the  for my company “Joe’s Garage”, I could\ndo the following:\n\nObtain a certificate file, either from my records, or from my web server. One simple way to retrieve the certificate file from the web server is to inspect the certificate that is presented to a browser when browsing to the server. In Chrome for example a right-click on the address line lock icon, and selection of the “connection” tab will allow examination of the certificate. The certificate information dialog should allow downloading the certificate as a file. Save the file in Base 64 encoded format. This mechanism should also work for retrieving the Bandwidth Dashboard certificate for use in validating our identity in callbacks.\nBase 64 encode the resulting file contents. Open the downloaded file in a text editor, and copy the contents (including the “---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---“ and “---END CERTIFICATE---“ into a Base 64 encoder (for example https://www.base64encode.org/ ) and encode the entire contents into Base 64 again. This eliminates strange characters. The resulting blob will have nothing but base 64 encoded data.\nTake the text created in 2 above, and use it as the payload element data for the  element.\n\n"},"errors.html":{"url":"errors.html","title":"Errors","keywords":"","body":"\n\n"},"apiReference.html":{"url":"apiReference.html","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  RAML.Settings.proxy = '';\n\n"},"guides/onDemandNumberSearchAndOrder.html":{"url":"guides/onDemandNumberSearchAndOrder.html","title":"Ondemand Search and Ordering","keywords":"","body":"\n\nSearch and order Phone Numbers on Demand \nAbout \nThis guide will walk through the recommended approach to searching and ordering phone numbers using the Bandwidth Phone Number API.  This will cover how to setup a subscription to manage phone number order alerts, how to search for available phone numbers, and finally how to order phone numbers.\nUse-cases\nThis guide is best suited for use-cases where an end-user is assigned a new specific phone number and may want to customize their phone number.\nIn the case where a user would like to keep their existing phone number, follow the porting guide.\nAssumptions\n\nYou have signed up for the Bandwidth Phone Number API\nYou are familiar with:\nYour API Credentials\nAsync Nature of ordering phone numbers\nManaging Locations\nManaging Sites\nReceiving HTTP Callbacks/Webhooks\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nCreate Subscription\nSearch for Phone Numbers\nCreate order for Phone Numbers\nReceive HTTP Callback with order status\nFetch information about order (optional)\n\nCreate Subscription for Orders \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number API allows users to manage notifications on their account through the /subscriptions resource.

Searching only provides a list of available numbers that match the search criteria.\nThere are a number of search approaches that can be used; the NPA NXX search is used for this example.  Please see the [guide on searching phone numbers for the other applicable search types.\nBase URL\nGEThttps://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{{accountId}}/availableNumbers\nQuery Parameters\n\n\n\nParameters\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnpaNxx\nNPA NXX combination to be searched.  - Valid npa values:[2-9] for the first digit, and [0-9] for both the second and third digits.  - Valid Nxx values:[2-9] for the first digit, and [0-9] for both the second and third digits.  - Valid x values [0-9].\n\n\n\nThis example only demonstrates searching by NPA NXX to learn about the different search types and filtering see the guide on searching phone numbers.\nExample: Search by NPA NXX\nGET https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{{accountId}}/availableNumbers?npaNxx=540551&quantity=7 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\nAuthorization: {user:password}\n\nResponse\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\n\n\n\n    7\n    \n        5405514342\n        5405515330\n        5405515329\n        5402278098\n        5402270905\n        5402278089\n        5402278090\n    \n\n\n\n\nOrder Phone Numbers \n\nTo successfully order a Phone Number that was previously returned in a search on the /availableNumbers you will create a  with a  containing at least 1 phone number.\nThere is no guarantee that the a telephone number appearing in search results will still be available by the time an order request is processed.\nIn this example, the s are known by the previous search.\nIt is worth noting that most orders complete very quickly (less than 1 second).\n\nBase URL\nPOSThttps://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{{accountId}}/orders\nCommon Request Parameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nThe name of the order.

Setting the PartialAllowed to false would trigger the entire order to be fulfilled (any error encountered such as 1 TN not being available would fail all TNs in the order)  Default: false\n\n\n\nNo\nBackOrderRequested will indicate to the system that if the entire quantity of numbers is not available on the first attempt to fill the new number order, the request will be repeated periodically until the request is successful or canceled.  true - Backorder numbers if the entire quantity is not available  Default: false\n\n\n\nYes\nA list of telephone numbers to order.\n\n\n\nYes\nTelephoneNumberList must have at least one TelephoneNumber to order   Part of the  element.\n\n\n\nExample: Order 1 Number Returned in the Search above\nPOST https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{{accountId}}/orders HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\nAuthorization: {user:password}\n\n\n    123456789\n    My Custom Name or UUID of a customer session\n    \n        \n            5402278098\n        \n    \n    743\n\n\nResponse\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\nLocation: https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{{accountId}}/orders/c9dg306c-gdh7-77j7-812c-0520c8f49123\n\n\n\n    \n        1234567896\n        Existing Number Order 3\n        2018-03-20T19:51:20.886Z\n        false\n        c9dg306c-gdh7-77j7-812c-0520c8f49123\n        \n            \n                5402278098\n            \n        \n        true\n        13606\n    \n    RECEIVED\n\n\n\n\nReceive HTTP Callback with Order Status \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number API will send a HTTP Callback (webhook) to the URL specified in the ... when creating the subscription.\nThe HTTP Callback will contain information if the order was successful or failed.  For our example here, if status is anything other than COMPLETE the order has failed.  The most likely scenario is that another customer ordered the desired phone number between the time 'searched' and 'ordered'.  If the order is not COMPLETE, either try ordering a different phone number, or search for more numbers.\nCallback Request Parameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this tutorial should only yield two possible Status values:  - COMPLETE : The order succeeded and all phone numbers requested were ordered and will be sent in the  list.  - FAILED : The order did not succeed (at least 1 phone number sent in the order was unable to be ordered).

The numbers will be searched for according to the indicated criteria, and, if found, will be activated in the network without intermediate confirmation with the requestor.  Under most conditions, the time between the request for numbers, and the selection and activation of those numbers in the bandwidth network, happens in les than a second.   There are cases in the ordering of numbers where the completion and activation of the telephone numbers in the network is not near-real-time, such as in the case where the numbers are backordered for later completion.  These facts, coupled with the need to persist an order record beyond the activation period of the telephone numbers has motivated the use of an asynchronous model, where the response to the request is an interim response, and the final completion of the order happens at some later time.\nIn light of the fact that these interactions are handled in a machine-to-machine manner, coupled with the considerations of our asynchronous model, has motivated us to ensure that an order always has a state, and that state is always available via the API.   The State Transition Diagram describing these states is below.  Any attempt to query an order will indicate one of these states.\n\nThe meaning of the states is provided in the following table.\n\n\n\nState\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nReceived\nA transitional state indicating that the order has been received by the system, and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\nComplete\nAll numbers in the request have been activated in the network. This is a final state.\n\n\nPartial\nSome of the numbers needed to fulfill the request have been activated in the network, and no more numbers will be activated as part of this order.  This is a final state. See the  element described below.\n\n\nFailed\nNone of the numbers needed to fulfill the request have been activated in the network, and no more numbers will be activated as part of this order.  This is a final state. See the  element described below.\n\n\nBackordered\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard may have activated some of the requested numbers in the network, but it is continuing to find and activate more numbers.  An order may remain in this state for a number of days.\n\n\n\nCreating an Order \nThe user can order numbers to their account using the HTTP POST Request Format method. This can be done either through a search for available numbers or by passing a description of the specific numbers to be ordered.\nAs in other asynchronous workflows, the request to order a new telephone number is created by a POST to a resource dedicated to the purpose to tracking new number requests – the accounts/{account-id}/orders resource\nIf the request is valid the Bandwidth Phone Number API will create an order resource, and will return an order ID which should be used in querying for the status for an order.  Success will be indicated by a 201 Created return code, and will include a link to the Order resource in the Location header of the response.\nNew Number Order Request Format \nAll New Number orders are sent to the Bandwidth Dashboard as requests to create a new number order record.  That new number order record is used to report the results of the order, as well as to track the status of the order if it remains open as a back-order for the numbers.\nThere are a number of different ways of ordering numbers using the Bandwidth Dashboard APIs, reflecting various approaches that can be used to search the available number inventory.  In summary, the various types are:\nExisting Number orders, used if the numbers are known to be available based on a prior search.\n\nArea Code / NPA search based orders\nNPA-XXX, and NPA-NXX-X search based orders\nRate Center search based orders\nState, and City/State search based orders\nZIP Code search based orders\nLATA search based orders\nToll free number orders\n\nThese different order types have different parameters that guide the ordering process, and thus have different parameters as part of their order requests.\nThe order requests are communicated via a POST API call with a payload that describes the order parameters.\nNew Number Order Response Format \nThe network APIs return an XML payload in response to a request. In addition, an HTTP 201 location header message is returned for all requests. Sample is shown here:\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/orders/{orderId}\n\nThe Location header represents the URL that can be fetched representing the current status of a new number order.\nBackordering Numbers \nIf not all of the requested telephone numbers are available at the time that the order is placed, the order can optionally be placed in a “Backordered” state, for subsequent completion by the Bandwidth Phone Number API.  The order will remain in this state until the order is filled, or until the order is closed.\nAn order will be a candidate for backordering if the  element is included in the request payload, with a value of “true”.\nNew Number Order States \nOrders placed for new numbers usually complete rapidly, returning either all, some or none of the numbers requested, based on the availability of numbers in the Bandwidth available inventory.  The final disposition of the order is reflected in the  element:\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFAILED\nNo telephone numbers available\n\n\nPARTIAL\nSome but not all of the requested telephone numbers were available and provided\n\n\nCOMPLETED\nAll of the requested telephone numbers were provided\n\n\n\nIf a new number order has been tagged to indicate that telephone numbers are to be backordered and the indicated quantity is not immediately available, then the order will remain active, and the interim status of BACKORDERED will be indicated in the  element when the order is examined with a GET  referencing the order-id.\nRequesting a backorder via the API .\nIf the API call has the  element set to true, then the order will be retained by the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard until it can be filled or until it is closed via an API call or GUI status update.\nThe  element and the  element interact in the completion of the order.  The interaction is described in the following table:\n\n\n\nCondition\nBackorder Requested\nPartial Allowed\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\nRequested number of Telephone Numbers is found\nn/a\nn/a\nUser gets their TNs\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\ntrue\ntrue\nAvailable TNs are ordered and the Order is placed into Backordered status for subsequent fulfillment and notification\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\ntrue\nfalse\nThe order is placed into Backordered status for subsequent fulfillment and notification, which will occur only on 100% availability. No numbers will be allocated to the order until the full request can be completely satisfied.\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\nfalse\ntrue\nAvailable TNs are ordered, and the order is completed and transitioned to the terminal \"PARTIAL\" state indicating that the order was partially filled\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\nfalse\nfalse\nOrder Fails. Not enough numbers are available.\n\n\nNone Found\nsee above\nsee above\nSame as for \"Less Than\", except that the entire order goes into BackOrder status immediately\n\n\n\nUsage Recommendations: \nAlthough there are no restrictions on the order-types for which backorder requests can be submitted via the API, it is recommended to avoid submitting backorders for zipcode, npanxx and npanxxx order types, largely because of the difficulty of filling requests of those types if the inventory is not immediately available.\nIn the case of npanxx and npanxxx order types, the specific dial plan elements are often no longer available, and in the case of zipcode orders there are cases where the relationship between zipcode and dial plan is not represented in the available data.\nUpdating a new-number order \nWith the introduction of Backorder capabilities, new number orders may stay in backordered state for a period while the order is filled.   While in this state it is possible to update the modifiable fields in the record, as well as to request that backorder processing of the order be ended.\nThose updates to incomplete orders are facilitated by a PUT on the order-id.\nClosing a backordered order retains any telephone numbers that have already been assigned to the account, and the order will typically convert its status to PARTIAL state, indicating that some requested numbers were not provided. If no numbers were provided the final state will be FAILED.\n"},"guides/reservingNumbers.html":{"url":"guides/reservingNumbers.html","title":"Reserving Phone Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Reserving Phone Numbers\nReserves a telephone number for a default time of 4 hours. A successful reservation returns a location header that can be used to retrieve the reservation at a later time.\nThis API permits a TN wanted by an end user to be placed in a “Reserved” state for a limited period of time.  While in the “Reserved” state the TN will not show up in searches, and cannot be ordered by any other party than the one that placed the TN into the “Reserved” state.  This allows an End User to find a TN that they want to purchase, and be assured that the TN will still be available once the rest of the commercial transaction is complete.  If the TN is not ordered within a timeout period, the “Reserved” state is removed and the TN can once again be ordered.\nIn addition to the normal work-flow, the API permits the cancellation of a reservation, reporting on outstanding reservations, and provides the mechanism to control access to the capability at the account level.\nThere is a small gap in the work-flow that will prevent two parties to compete for a TN.  If two searches are run that find the same number, only the first one to place a reservation on that number will be able to order it.  The alternative to this approach, essentially auto-reserving numbers that are searched, would cause too large an impact to the TN inventory.\nThe following API calls are used to manage the Reservation of TNs as part of the Ordering process.  Reservation is not enabled on all accounts.   If reservation is allowed for an account, the customer can reserve an available TN using a POST that will return a reservation ID that can be used to manage the reservation.\nAn API user can cancel a Reservation that is no longer required the DEL  method.\nUser without Admin privileges can retrieve reservations only by using the ReservationID:\n\nOrdering a TN that has been reserved is done using the  order type, and requires that the order contains the ReservationID for any numbers that have been previously reserved.   If the Reservation ID is not included with the order, a Reserved TN will not be successfully ordered.\nIt is also possible to discover reservations pending against a specific TN by interrogating the TNReservation resource associated with a TN.  This query is restricted to providing information that does not cross account boundaries.\n\n"},"guides/portingPhoneNumbers.html":{"url":"guides/portingPhoneNumbers.html","title":"Porting Phone Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Porting-in Phone Numbers \nOverview\n\nAbout Porting\nOverview of the Port-in Process\nChecking LNP Availability\nCreating an LNP Order\nLOA Upload\nSupported File Types\nCURL Example\nFile Meta-Data\n\n\nModifying an LNP Order (Supp LNP Order)\nCanceling LNP Order\nActivating Ported Numbers\n\nAbout Porting \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard provides an API that can be used to submit Port-In requests.  These requests to move phone numbers from a \"losing carrier\" to Bandwidth are part of the Local Number Portability (LNP) process.  These LNP requests are automatically validated and processed.  If the order fails during processing, it will be held for exception processing.  Customers can catch and fix exceptions 2 different ways:\n\nThe customer's application can check the status of port-in orders, and re-submit or cancel them through the API.\nThe customer's LNP team can check the status of port-in orders, and re-submit or cancel them through the Bandwidth Dashboard UI\n\nOverview of the Port-in Process \nThe external events in the porting process are documented in the diagram below.\nNOTE: Exceptions are outlined as synchronous and asynchronous in the Appendix A: LNP Exception Codes.\nThe Orders that are managed by the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard to implement the above workflow are reported in the order records that are reported through the API calls below.  These “order states” comply with the state transitions captured in the following diagram:\n\nChecking LNP Availability \nA number or numbers can be checked to see if they can be ported into the Bandwidth Network using an LNPChecker API call.\nThe fullcheck query parameter values control the components of the response payload that is returned:\nfullcheck Query Parameter Behvaior\n\n\n\nParameter value\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfalse (default)\nReturn only rate center information\n\n\ntrue\nAdditional information will be provided on the losing carriers associated with the listed numbers\n\n\nonnetportability\nProvides rate center and losing carrier information for onnet tiers only\n\n\noffnetportabilty\nIn addition to on-net information return off-net port information in  element with Partner/Vendor that the port will be supported on.

An order number will be auto-generated and provided to the customer. The order must pass synchronous and asynchronous validation. Synchronous validation will return validation failures immediately in the response. If synchronous validation passes, but asynchronous validation fails, the customer will not receive the error response until they check the order status.\nAs in other asynchronous workflows, the request to port in a number is created by a POST to a resource dedicated to the purpose to tracking requests – the accounts/{accountId}/portins resource\nLOA Upload \nAfter successfully submitting the Create LNP Order request, an LOA may be uploaded using our LOA API.\nSupported File Types \nThe following MIME types are supported for the LOA upload file:\n\nPDF(“application/pdf”)\nPLAIN(“text/plain”)\nJPG(“image/jpeg”)\nTIFF(“image/tiff”)\nCSV(“text/csv”)\nXML(“application/xml”)\nWAV(“audio/x-wav”)\nZIP(“application/zip”)\n\nCURL Example \nUse the order-id returned in the Create LNP Order response.\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: ' --data-binary \"@\" –iv /portins//loas\n\nExample:\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/pdf' --data-binary \"@Test_LOA.pdf\" -iv /portins//loas\n\nFile Meta-Data \nIt is often useful to attach additional data to an order in the form of an attached file, and so the existing LOA capability has been extended to optionally allow different file information to be included with a file, to describe type and purpose information.  The Meta-Data associated with a file includes a file document name and a document type, which is one of:\n\nLOA\nINVOICE\nCSR\nOTHER\n\nModifying an LNP Order (Supp LNP Order) \nThe API allows a user to modify an existing LNP order. The order number that was generated in the create LNP order request must be provided. Modifications are only allowed for orders that are not yet complete or cancelled. After the FOC date has been received, the billing telephone number and subscriber information cannot be modified, only the FOC date/time can be updated.\nCanceling LNP Order \nThe API allows a user to cancel an existing LNP order. The order number that was generated in the create request must be provided. The status of the order shall not be marked as COMPLETE i.e. you cannot cancel a completed order.  The DEL  method is used for this purpose.\nActivating Ported Numbers \nThe by default the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will activate ported wireline numbers shortly after 11:30 am on the FOC date.\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will also support customer “on demand” activation of numbers on the FOC date, if the intent to use the “on demand” activation is declared when the Port Order is created.  This declaration is done by including a  element in the /portin order request.\nIf on demand activation is indicated, then the customer will specify a default activation time in the initial port request, and can request activation of the port at any time up until that default activation time.   If a port has not been activated by the default activation time, the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will activate the port.\nIf activation by the default activation time on the FOC date is not achievable it is possible to delay activation for up to the third day after the FOC date, acknowledging that the losing carrier may have removed service from TN on the FOC date.\nActivation and management of on-demand ports is done via the activationStatus resource.  The activationStatus resource is created by the system when activation is available for the port request, and can be modified by PUT to activate the port, or to delay the activation in the case that the manual activation cannot be completed on time.\nPayload Parameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAutoActivationDate\nYes\nDate\nThis date controls both the activation of the Port, and delays in activation of the port.   - If AutoActivationDate is in the past, then the port will be activated  - If AutoActivationDate is in the future then the port will be delayed until the specified time, as long as that new time does not validate other restrictions on the activation of the port.  The typical guard time applied to this capability is 3 business days.\n\n\n\n"},"guides/testingPorting.html":{"url":"guides/testingPorting.html","title":"Testing Porting","keywords":"","body":"Testing Porting in The Bandwidth Interop Environment\nOverview\n\nAbout\nTNs that return Supported in the LNPchecker\nTNs that return Unsupported in the LNPChecker\nTNs that fail the LNP Order creation synchronously\nTNs that pass the synchronous check and fail the async check\nTNs that succeed all the way through\nPorts that are managed at every step of the way\nGet a test user\nEstablish a Manual Offnet port\nUpdate the state\nUpdate the FOC Date\nFinally\n\n\nNPA NXX pairs for testing Porting\nRate Centers for Manual Porting\nUnsupported Rate Centers\n\nAbout \nThere are a number of port-in test scenarios that can be exercised in the “Interop” API testbed environment before going live in the production environment.  The scenarios, and how to simulate them, are listed below.\nBefore we dig into those scenarios however, it is worth understanding something about how numbers are checked, and what numbers will pass and fail checks.\nThere are a number of checks that are performed in assessing portability:\n\nCoverage for the number if the port is accepted – there must be a way to connect to the host rate center for processing the calls, so we must have direct or partner connectivity to the rate center that is responsible for routing calls to that number.\nOur ability to work with the losing carrier to execute the port - a condition that very seldom fails.\nThe NPAC ownership of the Number, and our ability to work with that carrier to execute the port.\nThe nature of the service, and our ability to support porting of that service type.\nThe status of a number\n\nWe have been investing in supporting more combinations of the above conditions, making it harder to find failure cases.\nThere are 3 “kinds” of ports that are supported by the Bandwidth API:\n\nAutomated, where the entire port can be handled by API connections to other carriers\nInternal, where the entire port is handled within Bandwidth, because it is between Bandwidth sub-networks or between Bandwidth customers\nManual, where some manual intervention is required, for example if the target rate center is owned by a partner, or the number is a Toll Free number.\n\nAll 3 types are supported by the Bandwidth API, and for the most part are handled transparently from the perspective or our customer.\nWith that context, here are approaches that can be used to test various behaviors in our interop test environment.\nTNs that return Supported in the LNPchecker \nFor this we need a couple of criteria to pass, including a simulation of an ownership check and a coverage check.  I have included a file of valid NPA NXX pairs [see NPA NXX pairs for testing Porting below] that define numbers that are (for simulation purposes) not owned by Bandwidth.   If a number nas an NPA NXX pair that is on this list then it will cause an Automated External Number port; otherwise, it will create an Internal (Account to Account) port.   For a port to succeed it should also be “covered” from a Bandwidth network perspective.  The /coveredRateCenters API call can be used to determine our ability to provide coverage, which should in turn support passage of the coverage check.\nThe ownership and coverage factors above will govern success of the portability check.\nTNs that return Unsupported in the LNPChecker \nThe easiest way to receive an unsupported response from the LNPChecker is to ask to port to an “uncovered” location that we do not support on our network.  There is a list below [see Unsupported Rate Centers below] of unsupported rate centers and the associated NPA and NXX values for the numbers in those Rate Centers.  Attempting to port in a numbers that match that pattern will not be supported because of the impossibility of providing coverage. Numbers in all of these NPA-NXX pairs should fail the check.  Another good way to ensure failure is to request porting for a number that is in “Available” state in our network, namely the number is available for ordering.  Since that number is not owned by any end user it will not be portable.  Finding a number in this state of already “Available” in our inventory can be done with the /accounts//availableNumbers API.  A third way to create a failure is to check the portability of a number that is already being ported.\nTNs that fail the LNP Order creation synchronously \nSyntactic errors (like TNs with too many digits) will cause a synchronous failure.  The best bet here is to create malformed payload elements.\nTNs that pass the synchronous check and fail the async check \nThis is a fun one, because we attempt to catch all of the things that we can synchronously.  The Async failures happen downstream, and we do not connect to downstream providers in the interop environment.  All is not lost however – we have a mechanism to manage the ports manually, and and can use this capability to simulate downstream asynchronous failures (and successful state transitions).   Managing manual ports can be done by many of the Bandwidth staff, although some preparation and coordination will be required.  If your account is appropriately configured they can also be supported via API calls (see section 1.6).  A support ticket should be opened to facilitate this style of testing, and setup may take a couple of days.  Simply use a number that would fall into one of the rate centers below. [see Rate Centers for Manual Porting below]\nTNs that succeed all the way through \nThe best way to observe the entire success path is to order a number into your account, and then port that number back into the same account. That exercises the entire flow including all notifications.  There will still be a minimum porting interval of approximately a day for these ports if the default settings are retained.\nTo reduce the interval, the port-in can be classified as a  port.  With the 0 days minimum interval for internal ports that is set in the Interop test environment, you can request a  or \"Customer Activated\" port, and a request an activation time in the near future.  That will allow two things:\n\nThe activation of that port at the requested default time\nThe ability to \"trigger\" (activate) the port prior to the requested default activation time using the /accounts/{accountId}/portins/{orderid}/activationStatus API call.\n\nThis will shorten the interval to a shorter time for portins from an account back to the same account.\nPorts that are managed at every step of the way \nThe final step in testing porting is to test the various states that the port may reach, and controlling the state transitions within the allowed state transitions.  This will allow you to test otherwise unreachable states, and although this will not provide the full range of error messages that might be associated with a port and its failure conditions, it will allow you to exercise a broader range of state changes and notifications.\nIn order to take advantage of this testing step, you will have to contact your Bandwidth representative, and work with them to create a special manual port management user ID.   Please refer them to this document so that they understand what you are attempting to set up.  This user will be able to change the state of Manual Ports, and to set the FOC Date of portin orders in FOC state.  This user will only be created for the interop test environment – these capabilities are not allowed in a production environment, and the specially constrained user will not be set up in that environment.\nOnce the user has been established you will be able to control the port state and state transitions for Manual Ports.  The sequence of events that you will go through to execute these tests is as follows:\n1. Get a test user \nGet a user created and issued to you for testing, as described above\n2. Establish a Manual Offnet port \nEstablish a Manual Offnet port, either through the Portal or the API.  A Manual Offnet port is one that would port in a number that is in a Rate Center of one of our partners.  This form of port is usually managed by Bandwidth staff, who take care of moving the port through the various stages of its life-cycle, but in this case you will be acting in that role, and making the (allowed) state transitions via API calls.  To create a Manual Offnet port, attempt to port in a telephone number that has the NPA NXX pattern described in the appendix “Rate Centers for Manual Porting”.  Creation of this order will result in an portin-id that can be used in subsequent steps.\nThere is some chance the user might select a number that is in a ‘pending’ status that someone else has been working with. The user will receive an appropriate error on an LNPchecker request in that situation.\n3. Update the state \nMake changes to the state of the port using a PUT API call on the portin order created in step 2:\nPUT https://{{base-url}}/accounts/{{account-id}}/portins/{{portin-id}} HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\nAuthorization: {user:password}\n\n\n    EXCEPTION\n\n\nWhere the  value is the desired next state\n\nResponds\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\n\n\n    2dd9df95-71fa-4898-8002-a2ed1c50a4da\n    \n        200\n        \n               Supp request received. Please use the order id to check the status of your order later.\n        \n    \n    REQUESTED_SUPP\n\n\nThe  in the response can be ignored – it is not representative of the actual next state in this case.\n4. Update the FOC Date \nOnce the order is in FOC state the FOC date can also be changed for that port using a similar APU call.  Note that the payload may contain the state transition and the FOC date change.  This sets or changes the actual FOC date, not the requested FOC date.\nPUT https://{{base-url}}/accounts/{{account-id}}/portins/{{portin-id}} HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\nAuthorization: {user:password}\n\n\n    2015-08-21\n    FOC\n\n\n… with a new FOC date.  This is only applicable for orders in or entering FOC state.\n5. Finally \nIf you are uncertain of the valid next steps for any state in the portin state transition model, the error payload will indicate the acceptable next steps.  The <> payload error will provide the available next states.\n\n    2dd9df95-71fa-4898-8002-a2ed1c50a4da\n    \n        400\n        Validation Failed.

This API will cause a synchronous API call to the endpoint configured for the account, and expect a response indicating the validity of the data, or any errors found in the data.\nThis port out verification API is documented in the /callbacks /portOutValidationCallbackApi section of the API Reference\nThe port-out process is a two-stage process.\n\nIn the initial stage, a request is made by the prospective winning carrier to remove (port-out) the number from the Bandwidth network so that it can be activated on the winning carrier’s network.  At this stage in the process, we will execute the port out validation call-back API to the URL that you provide us, and use the returned information in determining whether the number should be ported out.  If the port-out appears valid a port-out will be scheduled at a later date, and the prospective winning carrier will be informed\nAs a completely separate action, on the scheduled date, the telephone number will be removed from service in the Bandwidth number, and enabled for activation in the winning carrier’s network.\n\nThese two steps are completely independent.  The port out validation happens at the first stage.   A separate independent notification can be sent when the port-out actually happens (if it happens).  That notification can be an email, or via a different callback documented in the /subscriptions and the /callbacks /notificationCallbackApi sections of the API Reference.  It is important to note that a verification does not mean that a number will port out, or that it will not.  The results of the verification is used to support the process, but the actual decision to remove the number involves other factors, and the number may or may not be removed based on those other factors.  The number is not removed until just before the notification callback API is invoked.\nSetup \nAfter you have completed the initial development, and are ready to begin testing your API implementation against a representative system.  The environment for your testing will include a target test system that receives the API calls, a test account in our test environment, and access to an “LSR” test account in our test environment that you can use to instigate port-outs.\n\nYou should take the following steps to ensure that a test environment can be set up, and that you are ready to test.\n\nMake sure that your Bandwidth Representative has the REST API URL that the Bandwidth Dashboard will invoke on detecting a request for a port-out.  This URL needs to be configured into the test system\nMake sure that your Bandwidth Representative provides you access to a “target” test account from which you can port numbers.  This account may be a “loaner’, or a test account dedicated to your use.  This is the account that the numbers will be ported away from.\nIf necessary, make sure that your Bandwidth Representative has loaded that account with numbers that can be “ported out”, and that will cause successes and failures.\nAlso, get some account credentials for our “LSR” test account from Bandwidth.  You can use this account to initiate test port-out activities on the numbers that you want to use to perform tests.  This account is analogous to the accounts used by winning carriers to request port-out of a number.\n\nThe interop test system has fictional numbers, and will not result in the port-out of any telephone numbers in real systems.\nBandwidth will use the information above to configure the test account for your use, and notify you once the configuration is complete.  You will be able to log in to both the target account and the LSR account from the portal using the address https://test.dashboard.bandwidth.com/portal/#login .\nTesting \nThere are two events that will result in a port-out validation: 1) entry of an LSR request, or 2) a “circular” port-in, which invokes a port-in activity back to the losing account, triggering a port-out activity to match with the port-out.   This test approach allows testing of both events.\nBefore you commence testing it is recommended that you log in to the “target” account and verify that the telephone numbers that you need for testing are present on the account.  This can be validated simply by entering the list of target numbers into the “Search Telephone Numbers” text box on the right hand side of the main dashboard page.\nTesting an LSR-initiated port out \nAn LSR submission by a winning carrier can initiate a port-out.  To test an LSR-initiated port out…\n\nLog into the LSR account using the credentials provided.\nUnder the “Orders” menu, select “Submit an LSR”.  This will present you with a form that you can fill out to request the port-out of one of the numbers currently on the “Target” account.  Values in the PIN, Account, ZIP will be passed to the Port-out Validation API call that the Dashboard will make to your system.\nThis will create an “LSR Order”, which is the persistent record of the attempt. The results of the request should be presented back to you as a subsequent update of the LSR order.\nVarious failure conditions can result, come of which are fatal, like an unrecognizable TN.  Others, like an invalid PIN can be corrected and resubmitted.\nIt is recommended that the target FoC date for the LSR port-out request be chosen in the future so that the order can be cancelled, and the Telephone Number preserved for subsequent testing.\n\nTesting a port-in driven port-out \nAn API-initiated port-in can also initiate a port-out, resulting in the second approach to testing the port-out validation API implementation.  To test this scenario we use a “circular” internal port-in; essentially porting the telephone number into the same account on which it was already resident.  To perform this test…\n\nLog into the “Target” account using the credentials provided\nUnder the Orders menu select “Port Numbers” and fill in the provided form, using one of the telephone numbers already on the Target account.\nOn submission, this should create a port-in order that is tied to the requirement to port-out the number.  This in turn will execute the Port-in Validity check API call, and return the results to the port-in order.\nAs above, some failure conditions will be fatal, and others can be corrected.\nAgain as above it is recommended that the target FoC date be set in the far future, allowing the port-in request to be cancelled.   If this does not happen, the port-in will simply return the telephone number to the account.\n\nYou Bandwidth Representative can assist in the setup of the testing, and in the execution of the tests above using the Bandwidth Dashboard portal\nFeel free to use any of the provided resources to resolve issues that arise.\n"},"guides/adminFunctions.html":{"url":"guides/adminFunctions.html","title":"Administrative Functions","keywords":"","body":"Administrative Functions\nUsers\nThe users that have access for an account are accessible via a request to the users resource on the account.\nManaging User Passwords\nAlthough at this time the set of users that can access an account is managed directly by Bandwidth Personnel, it is possible to manage the password for a user.  This function is constrained so that a user may only reset their own password, and must place the API call using those credentials.\nThe password has a minimum length of 6 characters and a maximum length of 20.\nIn the case of a lost password Bandwidth support personnel can provide a password reset.\n"},"concepts/manageSites.html":{"url":"concepts/manageSites.html","title":"Managing Sub-accounts/Sites","keywords":"","body":"Managing Sub-accounts/Sites\nEach account may have one or more Sites defined.  Each Site may have one or more SIP Peers defined, which are the objects that contain the endpoints used to send and receive voice and data traffic.  Most customers may only need a single Site and SIP Peer, but this structure allows customers with multiple products, channels, customers and physical locations to easily model their endpoints.  In the Bandwidth Dashboard UI, \"Sites\" are referred to as \"Sub-account\", which is their most frequent use.  SIP Peers are referred to as \"Locations\" as they are most frequently used to model customer's physical locations.  Telephone numbers are associated with a single SIP Peer within a Site.  These same rules are applied in the Bandwidth Dashboard UI's account structure.\nPlease note that both the Sites(SubAccounts) and SIP Peers(Locations) are not intended to grow in an unbounded manner.   If you are finding the need to establish more than 50 Sites(SubAccounts), or 250 total SIP Peers(Locations) in order to address your business needs, please consult with your Bandwidth representative before moving beyond these thresholds.  System responsiveness and / or network issues may result if these thresholds are exceeded.\n\n"},"concepts/manageLocations.html":{"url":"concepts/manageLocations.html","title":"Managing SIP Peers (locations)","keywords":"","body":"Managing SIP Peers (locations) \nOverview\n\nAbout SIP Peers (locations)\nVoice/Data Traffic\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination service\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination and SMS services\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Termination service\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination, Termination and SMS services\nSIP Peer settings for Calling Name and other SIP Peer wide features\nCalling Name display\nFinal Destination URI\n\n\nDeleting a SIP Peer\nMoving TNs between SIP Peers\n\nAbout \nSIP Peer Management enables customers to configure and manage IP addresses and other attributes for their network connections to Bandwidth. Per section 9, the SIP Peer(s) are set up on the Site to manage the numbers assigned to the account.  In the User Interface, the SIP Peer is referenced as a Location instead of a SIP Peer just as a Site is referenced as a Sub Account.\nA SIP Peer is a gateway that sends or receives voice and data traffic to or from Bandwidth’s network. Customer must configure a default SIP Peer on the Site within an Account. Before you can create a SIP Peer, a Site (location) must be created. You can have multiple SIP Peers on a Site. Only one default SIP Peer is allowed per Site.\nAside from being an administration point for IP addresses for network ingress and egress, SIP Peers are also used to associate Telephone Numbers with a Site/Location and Account.  For a Site to order any Telephone Numbers, at least one SIP Peer must be created for the Site, and one of the SIP Peers needs to be designated as the “Default” SIP Peer with which to associate numbers.\nVoice/Data Traffic \nThere are three different types of customer calls and messages to and from Bandwidth:\n\nOrigination - Voice calls from PSTN phone numbers that are delivered to customer-owned telephone numbers.\nTermination - Voice calls from customer-owned telephone numbers that are delivered to PSTN or other on-net telephone numbers.\nSMS - Inbound text messages that are delivered to customer-owned telephone numbers and outbound text messages that are delivered to PSTN or other on-net telephone numbers\n\nThese services can be used independently.  The following sections outline how SIP Peers should be configured when different combinations of these services are used.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination service \nEach SIP Peer can be configured with multiple IP addresses that will be used in managing traffic presentation to the Customer.\nThe traffic can be presented to the customer IP endpoints using one of two models – either as a Random distribution across the available voice host IP endpoints, or using a sequential failover model where traffic is preferentially presented to the first IP address until an endpoint failure is detected.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination and SMS services \nThis section provides information on defining a SIP Peer for receiving inbound calls (from Bandwidth to customer) and text messages. In the example below, the same host is used for receiving and SMS messages. If there is a different host for origination and SMS, that fact can be identified in the tags. Multiple SMS Hosts and Voice Hosts are allowed as required.  The Termination Hosts field is identified with the DataAllowed element to permit SMS Data to flow in to the Bandwidth network.   The optional Port element is permitted if required.\nNote: In spite of the Termination Hosts data, this configuration can be blocked from Termination traffic with account level constraints\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Termination service \nTo define a SIP Peer for sending outbound calls (from customer to Bandwidth, the configuration includes parameters called TerminationHosts, specifiying the IP address from which IP voice packets will be presented to the Bandwidth network.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination, Termination and SMS services \nA SIP Peer can also be configured for all services, namely the ability to send and receive both voice and text messages.\nSIP Peer settings for Calling Name and other SIP Peer wide features \nA number of features can be established at the SIP Peer level, including Calling Name Display and Final Destination URI.\nCalling Name display \nEnabling Calling Name display (CNAM) for all TNs subtending a SIP Peer is done by configuring the CallingName feature for the SIP Peer.   This involves setting the CNAM Display default behavior on or off (true or false) and then declaring whether that default behavior needs to be enforced or can be overridden at the TN level.\nFinal Destination URI \nThe network configuration of a SIP Peer includes an optional attribute called finaldestinationuri. This is used when network connectivity to all previously provided hosts/IPs fails. Request format for the configuration of the SIP Peer, using this attribute, is:\nDeleting a SIP Peer \nA SIP peer can be deleted using the DELETE method.\nNote:  A SIP peer can be deleted only if there are no TNs.\nMoving TNs between SIP Peers \nA POST to the SIP Peer resource can be used to move Telephone Numbers between SIP Peers.\n"},"guides/managingLineFeatures.html":{"url":"guides/managingLineFeatures.html","title":"Managing Line Features","keywords":"","body":"Managing Line Options and Features \nOverview\n\nAbout\nSingle TN Option Assignment\nCalling Name Display\nCalling Name Display Update (LIDB)\n\n\nDirectory Listing and Directory Assistance (DLDA)\nDLDA Fields\n\n\nCreating and Managing a DLDA Order\nRetrieving the history of a DLDA order\nChecking DLDA information associated with a TN\n\nAbout \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard allows the association of a number of “Option” or “Feature” characteristics with a Telephone Number.\nInitially this capability is restricted to the management of Calling Name Display and Call Forwarding for the TN, but will be expanded to additional “Line Features” with subsequent releases.\nIn addition to the configuration of Calling Name information, other per-TN capabilities already supported by the API will be addressed in this new document section.\nSingle TN Option Assignment \nThere are a number of TN capabilities that can be easily assigned directly to the Telephone Number(TN) on a per-TN basis.   This set of Per-TN Options includes:\n\nCall Forwarding\nRewrite User\nInbound Calls Number Format\nRemote Party ID Format\n\nThe path for managing these options is: /accounts/{accountId>/sites/{siteId}/sippeers/{sippeerId}/tns/{tn#}\nCalling Name Display \nIn addition to setting Calling Name Display information on a per-TN basis as described above, the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard API allows the establishment of Calling Name Display settings for a collection of TNs at a time.  Bandwidth provides this API as a convenience to enable provisioning collections of TNs.  It can support the configuration of up to 1000 TNs in a single call.\nThe Calling Line Display is associated with TNs using a POST to the lineOptionOrders resource with a payload that describes the option and its disposition.\nThe key elements of the XML payload are:\n\nTelephoneNumber: The TN that Calling Name Display will be activated on\nCallingNameDisplay: [on | off | systemdefault ] where systemdefault will result in causing the TN to display the network default behavior.\n\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number API allows the updating of CNAM Display (LIDB) information in the network for Bandwidth TNs managed within the customer’s account.  This capability works within the same asynchronous work-order mechanism as is used for managing other delay-prone system interactions, where a “work-order” is created by the initial API call, and used as a reference for tracking and confirming the subsequent states, and the ultimate success and failure of the result.\nCalling Name Display Update (LIDB) \nThe Request to add LIDB information to the TNs in an account is made by a POST request to the /lidbs resource associated with an account.  This request contains a set of requests, each one specific to an individual TN on the account.\nDirectory Listing and Directory Assistance (DLDA) \nThe DLDA service allows the association of a name and address listing with a Telephone Number or Telephone Numbers in the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard system.  The DLDA API follows the asynchronous order processing request model described elsewhere in this document, where a request is submitted, an order ID is returned as an ID of that request or order, and then the request is fulfilled in the background.  The status of the request is reflected in the status of the order, and can be queried at any time.\nDLDA Fields \nThere are a number of fields involved in submitting a DLDA order, summarized in the table below:\n\n\n\nField Name\nField Meaning and Values\nAPI Element\nrequired\n\n\n\n\nListed Telephone Number\n10 Digit US Number\n\ny\n\n\nListing Type\nListed (in DA & Dir)NonListed (in DA Only),NonPublished (No DA & No Dir)\n\ny\n\n\nType of Account\nResidential orBusiness\n\ny\n\n\nListed Name Last\nLast Name or First Name of Business\n\ny\n\n\nListed Name First\nFirst Name or Remaining Name of Business\n\n\n\n\nListed Name First 2\nFirst name of Second Party.

The dldas resource represents the requests made to the Bandwidth Phone Number API to add or otherwise manage a request to associate a name and street address with the telephone number. This API allows the creation and observation of a DLDA work order that causes the update of name and address information in a network Database.\nRetrieving the history of a DLDA order \nThe history of a DLDA order can be retrieved with a GET on the /history resource, using the API signature: /accounts/{accountId}/dldas/{orderid}/history\nChecking DLDA information associated with a TN \nThe GET method retrieves detailed information about the phone number.\nGET /tns/{tn}/tndetails  retrieves detailed information about the phone number.\nIn addition to the name and address information inherent in a DLDA update, the DLDA information associated with the TN includes a  value that indicates whether the DLDA information has been successfully registered with the Listing provider, or is in some other state.  Valid values for the  element are:\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nThe information reported in the payload is the information that has been successfully registered with the Listing Provider.  If a subsequent attempt has been made and failed, the original successful status and information will be retained.  The failure can be interpreted based on the order state.\n\n\nFailed\nThe only attempt to update DLDA information for this TN has failed, and there is no DLDA information associated with the TN with the Listing Provider.\n\n\nPending-Editable\nAn attempt to update DLDA information with the Listing Provider is in progress, but can be altered.\n\n\nPending-Locked\nAn attempt to update DLDA information with the Listing Provider is in progress, but cannot be changed at this time.  A new order will be required once the current attempt succeeds or fails.\n\n\n\nIf the  of the DLDA order impacting the TN is transient, indicating that there is an order in process and the outcome is inconclusive, the DLDA information will be replaced with a link to the order currently processing a DLDA change for that TN.  This will be the case if the status is Pending-Editable or Pending-Locked.\n"},"guides/managingSubscriptions.html":{"url":"guides/managingSubscriptions.html","title":"Managing Subscriptions","keywords":"","body":"Managing Subscriptions\nThis article will contain information on how to manage subscriptions.\n"},"guides/managingOrders.html":{"url":"guides/managingOrders.html","title":"Managing Orders","keywords":"","body":"Managing Orders\nOverview\n\nAbout\nAssociating Notes with Work Orders\nOrder Change Notifications\nEmail Notifications\nCallback URL Notifications\n\nAbout \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard uses an “order” model for tracking the changes requested to the provisioned information that controls our customer and end-user experiences.   Major changes to the configuration of the network such as Ordering numbers, Porting in numbers, Porting numbers out, Disconnecting numbers are tracked with work-orders that record the changes and track them through the related work-flow.\nAssociating Notes with Work Orders \nThe following API calls are used to add notes to various types of work-orders, allowing events that involve the work-order to be tracked and reviewed.  The API can be used with users that have credentials to manage and modify the account that owns the work-order(s).\nOrder Change Notifications \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard has the capability to monitor portins and other work-order types for meaningful events and status changes, and notify one or more email addresses of those events.  The events that cause notification emails are state changes for all viable states for the applicable order-types, as well as for all events that add a Note to the order in question.\n\n\n\nOrder Type\nState Change\n\n\n\n\nPort-ins\nPENDING_DOCUMENTS, SUBMITTED, REQUESTED_SUPP, FOC, COMPLETE, EXCEPTION, SNAPBACK, REQUESTED_CANCEL, CANCELLED   Note that the PENDING_DOCUMENTS status is transient, and will be typically be followed immediately by SUBMITTED or CANCELLED.  It remains as part of the work-flow for backwards compatibility reasons.\n\n\nPhone Number Orders\nSUBMITTED, PARTIAL, COMPLETE\n\n\nPortouts\nCOMPLETE\n\n\nDisconnects\nCOMPLETE\n\n\n\nEmail Notifications \nThe email notification capability enables a user with permissions on an account to configure any email address for notifications.  This level of freedom was provided to allow credentialed users the flexibility to control the destination of the notifications, even if the destination does not share an email address with the account or user.\nThe email notification capability also processes responses (replies) to notifications, inserting the reply text into the Notes field of a work order.  This allows the work order to retain a record of the correspondence applicable to the evolution of that order.\nA subscription is a request to be notified by email of events that happen to outstanding work orders.  Subscriptions are associated with accounts, and apply to some or all of the work orders managed by that account.  The API for the notification framework is dedicated to the management of these subscriptions.\nSubscriptions can apply to a specific orderId, or to all order-ids of a certain type.  If the orderId is omitted in the subscription request it means that the subscription request is applicable to all orders of that type.\nDeletion of subscriptions is supported on a one-by-one basis.  Deleting all subscriptions associated with an order requires a GET request of all of those Subscriptions, and deleting them one by one.\nCallback URL Notifications \nThe Bandwidth dashboard API also allows the establishment of a “callback” URL that can be used to monitor work-orders or changes.   Rather than receiving an email, the callback URL is invoked, allowing the monitoring system to be notified about the order changes in a machine-to-machine manner.\nTo create a Notifications Callback Subscription the customer creates a POST request to the item being monitored (typically an Order or Port-in ) the user creates a POST request to the subscriptions resource associated with the account.\nIf the OrderId field is omitted, then the subscription will apply to all orders of the indicated OrderType.\nThe  value can be very large (100 years in seconds).  Note that even in the case of a long expiry, the subscription will be removed once the order (if specified) reaches a final state.\nUpdating a subscription is done via a PUT request to the subscription. This can be used to update the expiry request.   Requests to update the expiry are at the whim of the Bandwidth Dashboard.\nNote that the initial state changes for an order may happen very quickly, so subscribing to an order once the system creates it needs to account for the fact that the initial state may be different based on timing factors.  It is recommended that the application creating the subscription check the order status after the subscription is created to ensure the correct initial condition.\nIt is possible to remove specific subscriptions by ID.\nOnce a subscription with a callback URL is active, changes to the works-orders that are part of the active subscription will be notified by a POST to the provided URL\n"},"guides/reporting.html":{"url":"guides/reporting.html","title":"Reporting","keywords":"","body":"Reporting \nOverview\n\nFetching Information\nPagination\nAvailable Inventory: Rate Centers and Cities\nCities\nAvailable Inventory: NPA NXX combinations\nBilling Data Records REST APIs for Retrieving zipped files\nPOST a BDR zipped file request\nGET a BDR zipped file record\n\nFetching Information \nRetrieving information from the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard is typically achieved by issuing an HTTP GET  against an identifiable resource.  Rather than repeat all of the resource names in this section, simply suffice it to say that with a few exceptions, a GET  on a resource will yield the available information about that resource.\nQuery parameters are used to filter or restrict the information returned to the caller.\nPagination \nSince an account may have a very large number of orders or TNs, the system uses the pagination mechanism to control the number of results that are returned.\nWhen a query is issued and no pagination parameters are specified, the system returns the http status code of 404 (Not found) with a link in the body of the message that indicates how to specify the pagination parameters.\nAvailable Inventory: Rate Centers and Cities \nThe Rate Centers and Cities API Calls return information about the Bandwidth CLEC Network, including coverage data, indicating both the extent of on-net and off-net coverage, as well as number availability, again from an on-net and off-net perspective.\nThe rules are as follows:\n\nIf supported=true is specified, then the coverage or availability is reported for the Bandwidth CLEC only.\nIf supported=true is omitted, then the coverage or availability is reported for the combination of the Bandwidth CLEC and our partners\nIf available=true is applied, then only Rate Centers in which we have available numbers are reported.\nIf available is omitted, then all Rate Centers within the scope defined by supported will be returned.\n\nThese rules apply for both the /rateCenters and /cities API calls.\n\n\n\nSupported = true\nSupported is missing\n\n\navailable = true\nAvailable numbers within the Bandwidth CLEC network\nAvailable numbers within the Bandwidth CLEC network combined with our partner networks\n\n\navailable is missing\nCoverage in the Bandwidth CLEC\nCoverage of the combined Bandwidth CLEC + Partner networks\n\n\n\nCities \nThe supported and available query parameters used above in the /rateCenters API call operate in an identical manner for the /cities API.\nAvailable Inventory: NPA NXX combinations \nThe API supports discovering available inventory per NPA-NXX for a user supplied area code and state.\nBilling Data Records REST APIs for Retrieving zipped files \nThis API call allows the user to retrieve Billing Data Records (BDRs) for an account from the network for all billing records created during a specified date range.\nPOST a BDR zipped file request \nThe POST to request the retrieval is formatted to indicate the start and end date of the range.  Both dates are required for a valid request.\nA successful response to the POST also returns a link containing a BDR ID, included in the Location header.  This is the Identifier of the successful request, not the identifier of the file containing the BDRs. This link will be used to fetch the zipped file of billing records once the file is ready.\nGET a BDR zipped file record \nTo retrieve the zipped file with the BDR records, a GET is issued on the path returned in the location header.\nIf the zip file containing the BDR data is ready, this request will return 303 See Other with a Location Header redirecting the request to the BDR zip file content.\n"}}}
