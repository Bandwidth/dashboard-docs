Wikipedia (reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) defines REST as:\n\nA RESTful web service (also called a RESTful web API) is a simple web service implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST. It is a collection of resources, with four defined aspects:\n\nA base URI for the web service, such as http://example.com/resources/\nAn Internet media type of the data supported by the web service. This is often JSON, XML or YAML but can be any other valid Internet media type.\nA set of operations supported by the web service using HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).\nThe API must be hypertext driven.\n\n\nUsage of REST with the Bandwidth Phone Number API \nUsage of the REST model for APIs involves using the tools provided by the REST model to create a consistent API experience.  Bandwidth’s Phone Number APIs use:\nGET\nGET  for querying static resources, often paginating the results to manage large result sets that arise from dealing with large data sets such as Telephone Numbers\n\nSearch available number inventory\nREST HTTP GET\n\n\nReporting\nREST HTTP GET\n\n\n\nPOST and PUT\nPOST for creating resources, and PUT for updating resources.  In many cases POST results in the return of an identifier that is used in the subsequent management of that resource.\n\nOrdering numbers\nREST HTTP POST\n\n\nSIP Peer Management\nREST HTTP POST and PUT\n\n\n\nDELETE\nDEL  is seldom used.  In most cases, resources are persisted as history records and cannot be deleted.\nBase URLs and Environments \nAll resources are located at:\n\nBase URL for Interop – https://test.dashboard.bandwidth.com/api\nBase URL for Production – https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api\n\nThe payload/content of the REST messages is encoded in XML.  To provide information to the endpoints on how to interpret the content, a HTTP Header value is used to identify the content as XML content.  To achieve this the header “Content-Type” must be set as “application/xml” for all messages.  The “Authorization” header is used to include the Basic-encoded credentials\nAPI Calls to the Base URL will return an empty document (no content), and not perform any authentication or other processing.  A REST resource is required for any action on the part of the server.\nREST URLs and Parameters \nBandwidth attempts to maintain syntactic consistency in the specification and execution of the Bandwidth Dashboard API.  Some of the guidelines that serve as goals are:\n\nBackwards compatibility – Bandwidth remains committed to backwards compatibility in its API implementation, occasionally at the expense of API complexity or additional query parameters.\nDate flexibility – for most API calls that have dates as query parameters, the format yyyy-mm-dd or yy-mm-dd will be supported\nCase insensitivity – in many but not all cases elements of the REST URI are case insensitive.  Some resource names and identifiers are case sensitive by their nature, and some have not yet been converted to case insensitive parsing.\nProviding generic, robust resource descriptors for URIs remains a focus of the ongoing development, and will be attempted wherever changes can be made that do not violate our commitment to backwards compatibility.\n\n"},"concepts/asyncOrder.html":{"url":"concepts/asyncOrder.html","title":"Asynchronous Order Model","keywords":"","body":"Asynchronous Order Model\nMany system requests require the interaction of multiple “back-end” systems, and cannot be guaranteed to complete within a short time interval.  Additionally, for many of these requests it is valuable to retain a persistent record of the transaction or series of transactions.  Ordering Features and Services, and requesting number Porting, both fit into this class of activity.\nIn these cases, the Bandwidth Phone Number APIs use an Asynchronous model, where the initial request results in the creation of a unique “order”, which is identified by an order-id which is typically returned in the Location header of a POST request.  This order-id is then subsequently used to monitor and update the initial request.  In general, these order-ids are represented by a UUID, and will be preserved at least for the length of time required to fully complete the request.

The numbers will be searched for according to the indicated criteria, and, if found, will be activated in the network without intermediate confirmation with the requestor.  Under most conditions, the time between the request for numbers, and the selection and activation of those numbers in the bandwidth network, happens in les than a second.   There are cases in the ordering of numbers where the completion and activation of the telephone numbers in the network is not near-real-time, such as in the case where the numbers are backordered for later completion.  These facts, coupled with the need to persist an order record beyond the activation period of the telephone numbers has motivated the use of an asynchronous model, where the response to the request is an interim response, and the final completion of the order happens at some later time.\nIn light of the fact that these interactions are handled in a machine-to-machine manner, coupled with the considerations of our asynchronous model, has motivated us to ensure that an order always has a state, and that state is always available via the API.   The State Transition Diagram describing these states is below.  Any attempt to query an order will indicate one of these states.\n\nThe meaning of the states is provided in the following table.\n\n\n\nState\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nReceived\nA transitional state indicating that the order has been received by the system, and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n\nComplete\nAll numbers in the request have been activated in the network. This is a final state.\n\n\nPartial\nSome of the numbers needed to fulfill the request have been activated in the network, and no more numbers will be activated as part of this order.  This is a final state. See the  element described below.\n\n\nFailed\nNone of the numbers needed to fulfill the request have been activated in the network, and no more numbers will be activated as part of this order.  This is a final state. See the  element described below.\n\n\nBackordered\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard may have activated some of the requested numbers in the network, but it is continuing to find and activate more numbers.  An order may remain in this state for a number of days.\n\n\n\nCreating an Order \nThe user can order numbers to their account using the HTTP POST Request Format method. This can be done either through a search for available numbers or by passing a description of the specific numbers to be ordered.\nAs in other asynchronous workflows, the request to order a new telephone number is created by a POST to a resource dedicated to the purpose to tracking new number requests – the accounts/{account-id}/orders resource\nIf the request is valid the Bandwidth Phone Number API will create an order resource, and will return an order ID which should be used in querying for the status for an order.  Success will be indicated by a 201 Created return code, and will include a link to the Order resource in the Location header of the response.\nNew Number Order Request Format \nAll New Number orders are sent to the Bandwidth Dashboard as requests to create a new number order record.  That new number order record is used to report the results of the order, as well as to track the status of the order if it remains open as a back-order for the numbers.\nThere are a number of different ways of ordering numbers using the Bandwidth Dashboard APIs, reflecting various approaches that can be used to search the available number inventory.  In summary, the various types are:\nExisting Number orders, used if the numbers are known to be available based on a prior search.\n\nArea Code / NPA search based orders\nNPA-XXX, and NPA-NXX-X search based orders\nRate Center search based orders\nState, and City/State search based orders\nZIP Code search based orders\nLATA search based orders\nToll free number orders\n\nThese different order types have different parameters that guide the ordering process, and thus have different parameters as part of their order requests.\nThe order requests are communicated via a POST API call with a payload that describes the order parameters.\nNew Number Order Response Format \nThe network APIs return an XML payload in response to a request. In addition, an HTTP 201 location header message is returned for all requests. Sample is shown here:\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/api/accounts/{accountId}/orders/{orderId}\n\nThe Location header represents the URL that can be fetched representing the current status of a new number order.\nBackordering Numbers \nIf not all of the requested telephone numbers are available at the time that the order is placed, the order can optionally be placed in a “Backordered” state, for subsequent completion by the Bandwidth Phone Number API.  The order will remain in this state until the order is filled, or until the order is closed.\nAn order will be a candidate for backordering if the  element is included in the request payload, with a value of “true”.\nNew Number Order States \nOrders placed for new numbers usually complete rapidly, returning either all, some or none of the numbers requested, based on the availability of numbers in the Bandwidth available inventory.  The final disposition of the order is reflected in the  element:\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFAILED\nNo telephone numbers available\n\n\nPARTIAL\nSome but not all of the requested telephone numbers were available and provided\n\n\nCOMPLETED\nAll of the requested telephone numbers were provided\n\n\n\nIf a new number order has been tagged to indicate that telephone numbers are to be backordered and the indicated quantity is not immediately available, then the order will remain active, and the interim status of BACKORDERED will be indicated in the  element when the order is examined with a GET  referencing the order-id.\nRequesting a backorder via the API .\nIf the API call has the  element set to true, then the order will be retained by the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard until it can be filled or until it is closed via an API call or GUI status update.\nThe  element and the  element interact in the completion of the order.  The interaction is described in the following table:\n\n\n\nCondition\nBackorder Requested\nPartial Allowed\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\nRequested number of Telephone Numbers is found\nn/a\nn/a\nUser gets their TNs\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\ntrue\ntrue\nAvailable TNs are ordered and the Order is placed into Backordered status for subsequent fulfillment and notification\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\ntrue\nfalse\nThe order is placed into Backordered status for subsequent fulfillment and notification, which will occur only on 100% availability. No numbers will be allocated to the order until the full request can be completely satisfied.\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\nfalse\ntrue\nAvailable TNs are ordered, and the order is completed and transitioned to the terminal \"PARTIAL\" state indicating that the order was partially filled\n\n\nLess than the requested quantity is found\nfalse\nfalse\nOrder Fails. Not enough numbers are available.\n\n\nNone Found\nsee above\nsee above\nSame as for \"Less Than\", except that the entire order goes into BackOrder status immediately\n\n\n\nUsage Recommendations: \nAlthough there are no restrictions on the order-types for which backorder requests can be submitted via the API, it is recommended to avoid submitting backorders for zipcode, npanxx and npanxxx order types, largely because of the difficulty of filling requests of those types if the inventory is not immediately available.\nIn the case of npanxx and npanxxx order types, the specific dial plan elements are often no longer available, and in the case of zipcode orders there are cases where the relationship between zipcode and dial plan is not represented in the available data.\nUpdating a new-number order \nWith the introduction of Backorder capabilities, new number orders may stay in backordered state for a period while the order is filled.   While in this state it is possible to update the modifiable fields in the record, as well as to request that backorder processing of the order be ended.\nThose updates to incomplete orders are facilitated by a PUT on the order-id.\nClosing a backordered order retains any telephone numbers that have already been assigned to the account, and the order will typically convert its status to PARTIAL state, indicating that some requested numbers were not provided. If no numbers were provided the final state will be FAILED.\n"},"guides/reservingNumbers.html":{"url":"guides/reservingNumbers.html","title":"Reserving Phone Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Reserving Phone Numbers\nThis API permits a TN wanted by an end user to be placed in a “Reserved” state for a limited period of time.  While in the “Reserved” state the TN will not show up in searches, and cannot be ordered by any other party than the one that placed the TN into the “Reserved” state.  This allows an End User to find a TN that they want to purchase, and be assured that the TN will still be available once the rest of the commercial transaction is complete.  If the TN is not ordered within a timeout period, the “Reserved” state is removed and the TN can once again be ordered.\nIn addition to the normal work-flow, the API permits the cancellation of a reservation, reporting on outstanding reservations, and provides the mechanism to control access to the capability at the account level.\nThere is a small gap in the work-flow that will prevent two parties to compete for a TN.  If two searches are run that find the same number, only the first one to place a reservation on that number will be able to order it.  The alternative to this approach, essentially auto-reserving numbers that are searched, would cause too large an impact to the TN inventory.\nThe following API calls are used to manage the Reservation of TNs as part of the Ordering process.  Reservation is not enabled on all accounts.   If reservation is allowed for an account, the customer can reserve an available TN using a POST that will return a reservation ID that can be used to manage the reservation.\nAn API user can cancel a Reservation that is no longer required the DEL  method.\nUser without Admin privileges can retrieve reservations only by using the ReservationID:\n\nOrdering a TN that has been reserved is done using the  order type, and requires that the order contains the ReservationID for any numbers that have been previously reserved.   If the Reservation ID is not included with the order, a Reserved TN will not be successfully ordered.\nIt is also possible to discover reservations pending against a specific TN by interrogating the TNReservation resource associated with a TN.  This query is restricted to providing information that does not cross account boundaries.\n\n"},"guides/portingPhoneNumbers.html":{"url":"guides/portingPhoneNumbers.html","title":"Porting Phone Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Porting-in Phone Numbers \n\nAbout Porting\nOverview of the Port-in Process\nChecking LNP Availability\nCreating an LNP Order\nLOA Upload\nSupported File Types\nCURL Example\nFile Meta-Data\n\n\nModifying an LNP Order (Supp LNP Order)\nCanceling LNP Order\nActivating Ported Numbers\n\nAbout Porting \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard provides an API that can be used to submit Port-In requests.

These “order states” comply with the state transitions captured in the following diagram:\n\nChecking LNP Availability \nA number or numbers can be checked to see if they can be ported into the Bandwidth Network using an LNPChecker API call.\nThe fullcheck query parameter values control the components of the response payload that is returned:\nfullcheck Query Parameter Behvaior\n\n\n\nParameter value\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfalse (default)\nReturn only rate center information\n\n\ntrue\nAdditional information will be provided on the losing carriers associated with the listed numbers\n\n\nonnetportability\nProvides rate center and losing carrier information for onnet tiers only\n\n\noffnetportabilty\nIn addition to on-net information return off-net port information in  element with Partner/Vendor that the port will be supported on.

The Tier information is provided for offnet rate centers.\n\n\n-SupportedLosingCarriers  -UnsupportedLosingCarriers\nDetails on the Losing Carrier including name, SPID, whether or not the carrier is a wireless carrier, whether or not account number is required as part of the CSR check, and the anticipated minimum number of days before a FoC date will be granted.\n\n\n\nCreating an LNP Order \nThe API allows a user to create a new LNP order. An order number will be auto-generated and provided to the customer. The order must pass synchronous and asynchronous validation. Synchronous validation will return validation failures immediately in the response. If synchronous validation passes, but asynchronous validation fails, the customer will not receive the error response until they check the order status.\nAs in other asynchronous workflows, the request to port in a number is created by a POST to a resource dedicated to the purpose to tracking requests – the accounts/{accountId}/portins resource\nLOA Upload \nAfter successfully submitting the Create LNP Order request, an LOA may be uploaded using our LOA API.\nSupported File Types \nThe following MIME types are supported for the LOA upload file:\n\nPDF(“application/pdf”)\nPLAIN(“text/plain”)\nJPG(“image/jpeg”)\nTIFF(“image/tiff”)\nCSV(“text/csv”)\nXML(“application/xml”)\nWAV(“audio/x-wav”)\nZIP(“application/zip”)\n\nCURL Example \nUse the order-id returned in the Create LNP Order response.\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: ' --data-binary \"@\" –iv /portins//loas\n\nExample:\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/pdf' --data-binary \"@Test_LOA.pdf\" -iv /portins//loas\n\nFile Meta-Data \nIt is often useful to attach additional data to an order in the form of an attached file, and so the existing LOA capability has been extended to optionally allow different file information to be included with a file, to describe type and purpose information.  The Meta-Data associated with a file includes a file document name and a document type, which is one of:\n\nLOA\nINVOICE\nCSR\nOTHER\n\nModifying an LNP Order (Supp LNP Order) \nThe API allows a user to modify an existing LNP order. The order number that was generated in the create LNP order request must be provided. Modifications are only allowed for orders that are not yet complete or cancelled. After the FOC date has been received, the billing telephone number and subscriber information cannot be modified, only the FOC date/time can be updated.\nCanceling LNP Order \nThe API allows a user to cancel an existing LNP order. The order number that was generated in the create request must be provided. The status of the order shall not be marked as COMPLETE i.e. you cannot cancel a completed order.  The DEL  method is used for this purpose.\nActivating Ported Numbers \nThe by default the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will activate ported wireline numbers shortly after 11:30 am on the FOC date.\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will also support customer “on demand” activation of numbers on the FOC date, if the intent to use the “on demand” activation is declared when the Port Order is created.  This declaration is done by including a  element in the /portin order request.\nIf on demand activation is indicated, then the customer will specify a default activation time in the initial port request, and can request activation of the port at any time up until that default activation time.   If a port has not been activated by the default activation time, the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard will activate the port.\nIf activation by the default activation time on the FOC date is not achievable it is possible to delay activation for up to the third day after the FOC date, acknowledging that the losing carrier may have removed service from TN on the FOC date.\nActivation and management of on-demand ports is done via the activationStatus resource.  The activationStatus resource is created by the system when activation is available for the port request, and can be modified by PUT to activate the port, or to delay the activation in the case that the manual activation cannot be completed on time.\nPayload Parameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nRequired\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAutoActivationDate\nYes\nDate\nThis date controls both the activation of the Port, and delays in activation of the port.   - If AutoActivationDate is in the past, then the port will be activated  - If AutoActivationDate is in the future then the port will be delayed until the specified time, as long as that new time does not validate other restrictions on the activation of the port.  The typical guard time applied to this capability is 3 business days.\n\n\n\n"},"guides/adminFunctions.html":{"url":"guides/adminFunctions.html","title":"Administrative Functions","keywords":"","body":"Administrative Functions\nUsers\nThe users that have access for an account are accessible via a request to the users resource on the account.\nManaging User Passwords\nAlthough at this time the set of users that can access an account is managed directly by Bandwidth Personnel, it is possible to manage the password for a user.

Each Site may have one or more SIP Peers defined, which are the objects that contain the endpoints used to send and receive voice and data traffic.  Most customers may only need a single Site and SIP Peer, but this structure allows customers with multiple products, channels, customers and physical locations to easily model their endpoints.  In the Bandwidth Dashboard UI, \"Sites\" are referred to as \"Sub-account\", which is their most frequent use.  SIP Peers are referred to as \"Locations\" as they are most frequently used to model customer's physical locations.  Telephone numbers are associated with a single SIP Peer within a Site.

Per section 9, the SIP Peer(s) are set up on the Site to manage the numbers assigned to the account.  In the User Interface, the SIP Peer is referenced as a Location instead of a SIP Peer just as a Site is referenced as a Sub Account.\nA SIP Peer is a gateway that sends or receives voice and data traffic to or from Bandwidth’s network. Customer must configure a default SIP Peer on the Site within an Account. Before you can create a SIP Peer, a Site (location) must be created. You can have multiple SIP Peers on a Site. Only one default SIP Peer is allowed per Site.\nAside from being an administration point for IP addresses for network ingress and egress, SIP Peers are also used to associate Telephone Numbers with a Site/Location and Account.  For a Site to order any Telephone Numbers, at least one SIP Peer must be created for the Site, and one of the SIP Peers needs to be designated as the “Default” SIP Peer with which to associate numbers.\nVoice/Data Traffic \nThere are three different types of customer calls and messages to and from Bandwidth:\n\nOrigination - Voice calls from PSTN phone numbers that are delivered to customer-owned telephone numbers.\nTermination - Voice calls from customer-owned telephone numbers that are delivered to PSTN or other on-net telephone numbers.\nSMS - Inbound text messages that are delivered to customer-owned telephone numbers and outbound text messages that are delivered to PSTN or other on-net telephone numbers\n\nThese services can be used independently.  The following sections outline how SIP Peers should be configured when different combinations of these services are used.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination service \nEach SIP Peer can be configured with multiple IP addresses that will be used in managing traffic presentation to the Customer.\nThe traffic can be presented to the customer IP endpoints using one of two models – either as a Random distribution across the available voice host IP endpoints, or using a sequential failover model where traffic is preferentially presented to the first IP address until an endpoint failure is detected.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination and SMS services \nThis section provides information on defining a SIP Peer for receiving inbound calls (from Bandwidth to customer) and text messages. In the example below, the same host is used for receiving and SMS messages. If there is a different host for origination and SMS, that fact can be identified in the tags. Multiple SMS Hosts and Voice Hosts are allowed as required.  The Termination Hosts field is identified with the DataAllowed element to permit SMS Data to flow in to the Bandwidth network.   The optional Port element is permitted if required.\nNote: In spite of the Termination Hosts data, this configuration can be blocked from Termination traffic with account level constraints\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Termination service \nTo define a SIP Peer for sending outbound calls (from customer to Bandwidth, the configuration includes parameters called TerminationHosts, specifiying the IP address from which IP voice packets will be presented to the Bandwidth network.\nSIP Peer configuration for use of Origination, Termination and SMS services \nA SIP Peer can also be configured for all services, namely the ability to send and receive both voice and text messages.\nSIP Peer settings for Calling Name and other SIP Peer wide features \nA number of features can be established at the SIP Peer level, including Calling Name Display and Final Destination URI.\nCalling Name display \nEnabling Calling Name display (CNAM) for all TNs subtending a SIP Peer is done by configuring the CallingName feature for the SIP Peer.   This involves setting the CNAM Display default behavior on or off (true or false) and then declaring whether that default behavior needs to be enforced or can be overridden at the TN level.\nFinal Destination URI \nThe network configuration of a SIP Peer includes an optional attribute called finaldestinationuri. This is used when network connectivity to all previously provided hosts/IPs fails. Request format for the configuration of the SIP Peer, using this attribute, is:\nDeleting a SIP Peer \nA SIP peer can be deleted using the DELETE method.\nNote:  A SIP peer can be deleted only if there are no TNs.\nMoving TNs between SIP Peers \nA POST to the SIP Peer resource can be used to move Telephone Numbers between SIP Peers.\n"},"guides/managingLineFeatures.html":{"url":"guides/managingLineFeatures.html","title":"Managing Line Features","keywords":"","body":"Managing Line Options and Features \n\nAbout\nSingle TN Option Assignment\nCalling Name Display\nCalling Name Display Update (LIDB)\n\n\nDirectory Listing and Directory Assistance (DLDA)\nDLDA Fields\n\n\nCreating and Managing a DLDA Order\nRetrieving the history of a DLDA order\nChecking DLDA information associated with a TN\n\nAbout \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard allows the association of a number of “Option” or “Feature” characteristics with a Telephone Number.\nInitially this capability is restricted to the management of Calling Name Display and Call Forwarding for the TN, but will be expanded to additional “Line Features” with subsequent releases.\nIn addition to the configuration of Calling Name information, other per-TN capabilities already supported by the API will be addressed in this new document section.\nSingle TN Option Assignment \nThere are a number of TN capabilities that can be easily assigned directly to the Telephone Number(TN) on a per-TN basis.   This set of Per-TN Options includes:\n\nCall Forwarding\nRewrite User\nInbound Calls Number Format\nRemote Party ID Format\n\nThe path for managing these options is: /accounts/{accountId>/sites/{siteId}/sippeers/{sippeerId}/tns/{tn#}\nCalling Name Display \nIn addition to setting Calling Name Display information on a per-TN basis as described above, the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard API allows the establishment of Calling Name Display settings for a collection of TNs at a time.  Bandwidth provides this API as a convenience to enable provisioning collections of TNs.  It can support the configuration of up to 1000 TNs in a single call.\nThe Calling Line Display is associated with TNs using a POST to the lineOptionOrders resource with a payload that describes the option and its disposition.\nThe key elements of the XML payload are:\n\nTelephoneNumber: The TN that Calling Name Display will be activated on\nCallingNameDisplay: [on | off | systemdefault ] where systemdefault will result in causing the TN to display the network default behavior.\n\nThe Bandwidth Phone Number API allows the updating of CNAM Display (LIDB) information in the network for Bandwidth TNs managed within the customer’s account.  This capability works within the same asynchronous work-order mechanism as is used for managing other delay-prone system interactions, where a “work-order” is created by the initial API call, and used as a reference for tracking and confirming the subsequent states, and the ultimate success and failure of the result.\nCalling Name Display Update (LIDB) \nThe Request to add LIDB information to the TNs in an account is made by a POST request to the /lidbs resource associated with an account.  This request contains a set of requests, each one specific to an individual TN on the account.\nDirectory Listing and Directory Assistance (DLDA) \nThe DLDA service allows the association of a name and address listing with a Telephone Number or Telephone Numbers in the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard system.  The DLDA API follows the asynchronous order processing request model described elsewhere in this document, where a request is submitted, an order ID is returned as an ID of that request or order, and then the request is fulfilled in the background.  The status of the request is reflected in the status of the order, and can be queried at any time.\nDLDA Fields \nThere are a number of fields involved in submitting a DLDA order, summarized in the table below:\n\n\n\nField Name\nField Meaning and Values\nAPI Element\nrequired\n\n\n\n\nListed Telephone Number\n10 Digit US Number\n\ny\n\n\nListing Type\nListed (in DA & Dir)NonListed (in DA Only),NonPublished (No DA & No Dir)\n\ny\n\n\nType of Account\nResidential orBusiness\n\ny\n\n\nListed Name Last\nLast Name or First Name of Business\n\ny\n\n\nListed Name First\nFirst Name or Remaining Name of Business\n\n\n\n\nListed Name First 2\nFirst name of Second Party.

The dldas resource represents the requests made to the Bandwidth Phone Number API to add or otherwise manage a request to associate a name and street address with the telephone number. This API allows the creation and observation of a DLDA work order that causes the update of name and address information in a network Database.\nRetrieving the history of a DLDA order \nThe history of a DLDA order can be retrieved with a GET on the /history resource, using the API signature: /accounts/{accountId}/dldas/{orderid}/history\nChecking DLDA information associated with a TN \nThe GET method retrieves detailed information about the phone number.\nGET /tns/{tn}/tndetails  retrieves detailed information about the phone number.\nIn addition to the name and address information inherent in a DLDA update, the DLDA information associated with the TN includes a  value that indicates whether the DLDA information has been successfully registered with the Listing provider, or is in some other state.  Valid values for the  element are:\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nThe information reported in the payload is the information that has been successfully registered with the Listing Provider.  If a subsequent attempt has been made and failed, the original successful status and information will be retained.  The failure can be interpreted based on the order state.\n\n\nFailed\nThe only attempt to update DLDA information for this TN has failed, and there is no DLDA information associated with the TN with the Listing Provider.\n\n\nPending-Editable\nAn attempt to update DLDA information with the Listing Provider is in progress, but can be altered.\n\n\nPending-Locked\nAn attempt to update DLDA information with the Listing Provider is in progress, but cannot be changed at this time.  A new order will be required once the current attempt succeeds or fails.\n\n\n\nIf the  of the DLDA order impacting the TN is transient, indicating that there is an order in process and the outcome is inconclusive, the DLDA information will be replaced with a link to the order currently processing a DLDA change for that TN.  This will be the case if the status is Pending-Editable or Pending-Locked.\n"},"guides/managingOrders.html":{"url":"guides/managingOrders.html","title":"Managing Orders","keywords":"","body":"Managing Orders\n\nAbout\nAssociating Notes with Work Orders\nOrder Change Notifications\nEmail Notifications\nCallback URL Notifications\n\nAbout \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard uses an “order” model for tracking the changes requested to the provisioned information that controls our customer and end-user experiences.   Major changes to the configuration of the network such as Ordering numbers, Porting in numbers, Porting numbers out, Disconnecting numbers are tracked with work-orders that record the changes and track them through the related work-flow.\nAssociating Notes with Work Orders \nThe following API calls are used to add notes to various types of work-orders, allowing events that involve the work-order to be tracked and reviewed.  The API can be used with users that have credentials to manage and modify the account that owns the work-order(s).\nOrder Change Notifications \nThe Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard has the capability to monitor portins and other work-order types for meaningful events and status changes, and notify one or more email addresses of those events.  The events that cause notification emails are state changes for all viable states for the applicable order-types, as well as for all events that add a Note to the order in question.\n\n\n\nOrder Type\nState Change\n\n\n\n\nPort-ins\nPENDING_DOCUMENTS, SUBMITTED, REQUESTED_SUPP, FOC, COMPLETE, EXCEPTION, SNAPBACK, REQUESTED_CANCEL, CANCELLED   Note that the PENDING_DOCUMENTS status is transient, and will be typically be followed immediately by SUBMITTED or CANCELLED.  It remains as part of the work-flow for backwards compatibility reasons.\n\n\nPhone Number Orders\nSUBMITTED, PARTIAL, COMPLETE\n\n\nPortouts\nCOMPLETE\n\n\nDisconnects\nCOMPLETE\n\n\n\nEmail Notifications \nThe email notification capability enables a user with permissions on an account to configure any email address for notifications.  This level of freedom was provided to allow credentialed users the flexibility to control the destination of the notifications, even if the destination does not share an email address with the account or user.\nThe email notification capability also processes responses (replies) to notifications, inserting the reply text into the Notes field of a work order.  This allows the work order to retain a record of the correspondence applicable to the evolution of that order.\nA subscription is a request to be notified by email of events that happen to outstanding work orders.  Subscriptions are associated with accounts, and apply to some or all of the work orders managed by that account.  The API for the notification framework is dedicated to the management of these subscriptions.\nSubscriptions can apply to a specific orderId, or to all order-ids of a certain type.  If the orderId is omitted in the subscription request it means that the subscription request is applicable to all orders of that type.\nDeletion of subscriptions is supported on a one-by-one basis.  Deleting all subscriptions associated with an order requires a GET request of all of those Subscriptions, and deleting them one by one.\nCallback URL Notifications \nThe Bandwidth dashboard API also allows the establishment of a “callback” URL that can be used to monitor work-orders or changes.   Rather than receiving an email, the callback URL is invoked, allowing the monitoring system to be notified about the order changes in a machine-to-machine manner.\nTo create a Notifications Callback Subscription the customer creates a POST request to the item being monitored (typically an Order or Port-in ) the user creates a POST request to the subscriptions resource associated with the account.\nIf the OrderId field is omitted, then the subscription will apply to all orders of the indicated OrderType.\nThe  value can be very large (100 years in seconds), or set to infinite (-1) if required.  Note that even in the case of a long or infinite expiry, the subscription will be removed once the order (if specified) reaches a final state.\nUpdating a subscription is done via a PUT request to the subscription. This can be used to update the expiry request.   Requests to update the expiry are at the whim of the Bandwidth Dashboard.\nNote that the initial state changes for an order may happen very quickly, so subscribing to an order once the system creates it needs to account for the fact that the initial state may be different based on timing factors.  It is recommended that the application creating the subscription check the order status after the subscription is created to ensure the correct initial condition.\nIt is possible to remove specific subscriptions by ID.\nOnce a subscription with a callback URL is active, changes to the works-orders that are part of the active subscription will be notified by a POST to the provided URL\n"},"guides/reporting.html":{"url":"guides/reporting.html","title":"Reporting","keywords":"","body":"Reporting \n\nFetching Information\nPagination\nAvailable Inventory: Rate Centers and Cities\nCities\nAvailable Inventory: NPA NXX combinations\nBilling Data Records REST APIs for Retrieving zipped files\nPOST a BDR zipped file request\nGET a BDR zipped file record\n\nFetching Information \nRetrieving information from the Bandwidth Phone Number Dashboard is typically achieved by issuing an HTTP GET  against an identifiable resource.
